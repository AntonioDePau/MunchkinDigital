rules.askingforhelp.1	Asking For Help
rules.askingforhelp.2	If you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask any other player to help you. If they refuse, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!<br><br>You’ll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster’s Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever.<br><br>The special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add to their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster’s combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster’s combat strength has already been increased).<br><br>If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. Treasure cards are then distributed according to the agreement you reached.<br><br>A few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win – and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don’t get to back out just because they’re about to win the game – so pay attention!
rules.askingforhelp.3	Running Away
rules.askingforhelp.4	If nobody will help you . . . or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow party members interfere so the two of you still cannot win . . . you must Run Away. You don’t get any levels or Treasure. You don’t even get to Loot the Room. And you don’t always escape unharmed . . .Roll the die. You escape on a 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.<br><br>If you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. If you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you. If two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster. The monster(s) CAN catch them both. Once you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).
rules.characterstats.1	Character Stats
rules.characterstats.2	Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class.<br><br>Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items).Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.<br><br>Class: In the base set, characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already. Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability, unless the ability specifies otherwise. See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. You can discard a Class card at any time during your turn, or whenever you have a jump-in window, even during combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card. You may not belong to more than one Class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.<br><br>Race: In the base set, characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human. Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply to Races. You may not belong to more than one Race at once unless you play the Half-Breed card.
rules.characterstats.3	Super Munchkin and Half-Breed
rules.characterstats.4	These cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.<br><br>If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin  while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)
rules.death.1	Death
rules.death.2	If you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Classes, Races, and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) – your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well. Once you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.<br><br>Looting The Body: The rest of your cards are presented to other players for looting. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands. Dead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.<br><br>When the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players. On your next turn, you draw four face-down cards from each deck and play any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then your turn continues as normal.
rules.monsters.1	Monsters
rules.monsters.2	If drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.<br><br>If you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player’s fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters)<br><br>Each monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.
rules.monsters.3	Monster Enhancers
rules.monsters.4	Certain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.<br><br><br>All enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.<br><br><br>Exception: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate. Good luck . . .
rules.monsters.5	Fighting Multiple Monsters
rules.monsters.6	Some cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!
rules.monsters.7	Undead Monsters
rules.monsters.8	Some monsters are tagged Undead. You may play any Undead monster from your hand into combat to help any other Undead, without using a Wandering Monster card. If you have a card that can be used to make a monster Undead, you may play it with a non-Undead monster to use this rule.
rules.overview.1	Overview
rules.overview.2	Character Creation
rules.overview.3	Everyone starts as a Level 1 Human with no Class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female.<br><br>At the start of the game one player is randomly chosen to be the start player. Before the start player's turn, each player has an opportunity to play Race, Class, and Item cards from their hand.
rules.overview.4	Goal of the Game
rules.overview.5	The first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.
rules.overview.6	Turn Phases
rules.overview.7	Your turn begins as soon as the previous player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase 1.<br><br>(1) Kick Open The Door<br><br>Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up. If it’s a monster, you must fight it. If the card is a Curse it applies to you immediately and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect). If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.
rules.overview.8	(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room<br><br>If you fought a monster in phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.<br><br>Look For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help!<br><br>Loot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.
rules.overview.9	(3) Charity<br><br>If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest,  the cards are divided as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess. As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.
rules.overview.10	When You May Take Actions
rules.overview.11	You may perform these actions at any time during your turn or whenever you have a jump-in window:<br><br>•Discard a Class or Race.<br>•Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.<br>•Play a Curse.
rules.overview.12	You may perform these actions at any time during your turn or whenever you have a jump-in window, as long as you are not in combat:<br><br>•Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).<br>•Change which Items you have equipped.<br>•Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).
rules.overview.13	You may perform these actions on your own turn:<br><br>•Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).<br>•Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).     <br>•Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat, but some one-shot Items can if they say so)
rules.treasures.1	Treasures
rules.treasures.2	Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any Treasure card may be played as soon as you get it, or at any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules below or the card itself says otherwise).
rules.treasures.3	Items
rules.treasures.4	Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.<br><br>Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.<br><br>Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.<br><br>You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff may force you to get rid of something!<br><br>Big Items: You may carry any number of small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.<br><br>If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least 1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them.<br><br>Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items in play – not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any Item you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players not to offer help in combat this turn. <br><br>Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.
rules.treasures.5	“One-Shot” Treasures
rules.treasures.6	A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is referred to as a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from your carry area. One-shot items are discarded after use. One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.
rules.treasures.7	Other Treasures
rules.treasures.8	Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded.<br><br><br>A couple of specific examples:<br><br><br>Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time during your turn or whenever you have a jump-in window. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!<br><br><br>Hireling may be played at any time during your turn or whenever you have a jump-in window. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.
rules.variants.1	Variants
rules.variants.2	The following variant rules can be toggled on and off when creating a game.
rules.variants.3	Faster Play Rules
rules.variants.4	For a faster game, you can add a “phase 0” called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally. If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.
rules.variants.7	Gender Neutral
rules.variants.8	"Gender matters" cards are removed from the game.
rules.combatoverview.1	Combat Overview
rules.combatoverview.2	To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative – given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away. If your combat strength totals more than the monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.<br><br>Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.<br><br>You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers.<br><br>If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards.
rules.combatoverview.3	Interfering With Combat
rules.combatoverview.4	You can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including:<br><br>•Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead . . .<br>•Play a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger . . . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else’s combat.<br>•Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.<br>•Backstab a player in combat, if you’re a Thief.<br>•Curse them, if you have a Curse card.
rules.curses.1	Curses
rules.curses.2	If drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards apply to the person who drew them. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time during your turn or whenever you have a jump-in window.<br><br>Usually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. These Curses stay in play until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. <br><br>Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn” Curse played during your turn.

t1.intro	Welcome to the monster-slaying, treasure-stealing, backstabbing world of Munchkin. Hold onto your seat, it’s time to dive into the dungeon.
t1.goal	You begin the game as a lowly Level 1 adventurer with no class (heh, heh). Your goal is to gear up, defeat monsters, and reach Level 10 before another player gets there first.
t1.char.build	At the start of the game, you'll get a hand of four cards from each of the Treasure and Door decks. Then, you'll get a chance to play any Class, Race, or Item cards you want to start the game with.
t1.moz.1.mobile	You can tap and hold any card in your hand to get a closer look. Let's check out that Slimy Armor.
t1.moz.1.pc	You can hover over any card in your hand to get a closer look. Let's check out that Slimy Armor.
t1.play.items	Looks disgusting, but you're never gonna make it around here if you won't lather yourself in slime for a +1 bonus!
t1.play.items.2	To wear Slimy Armor, drag it upwards and an "Equip" box will appear to place it in.
t1.total.strength	Notice that as you play these items, your combat strength increases. Combat strength is equal to your gear bonus plus your current Level.
t1.play.items2	Let's play the Buckler of Swashing to crank that number even higher. Equipment can't be played in combat, so it's worth gearing up ahead of time.
t1.end.char.creation	When you're done playing cards, click Continue to get this show on the road! (Or dark foreboding tunnel, as the case may be.)
t1.turn1	You're up first! At the start of your turn, you'll have a chance to play cards before Kicking Down the Door to the next room of the dungeon. But this time you're all geared up already, so let's get this party started!
t1.harpies	A monster appears! To defeat the Harpies in combat, your strength must be greater than its level. If you lose, you suffer Bad Stuff!
t1.tie.v1	Unfortunately, you are tied for strength: 4 to 4. But you've got a card in hand that can help! Check out this Warrior.
t1.class.v1	As you can see, Warriors win on ties! And unlike equipment, you can play a Class or Race at any time during your turn, even during combat. Go ahead and play that Warrior now.
t1.tie.v2	Normally you'd lose on a tie. But because you cleverly became a Warrior earlier, we're poised for victory!
t1.end.player.combat.phase	Click Attack to beat up that Harpy and take its stuff!
t1.gary.ponfusion	Not so fast! Gary, here. Also known as the Shrieking Geek. Before combat ends, your opponents get a chance to play cards – like this Cotion of Ponfusion I have to increase the Harpies' strength by 3!
t1.easy	It’s their first game Gary. We agreed we were going to take it easy on them, remember?
t1.gary.potion	Hey, I'm teaching a valuable lesson, here! Remember, newbie: Life sucks, and people are jerks! And hey, at least it's only a one-shot Item, so I can't do it again.
t1.jump.in	Don't worry, you get a chance to respond to Gary's nonsense. Go ahead and select Jump-In to take priority from Gary.
t1.oneshot.v1	Great! Now you can turn the table with that Freezing Explosive Potion! It's a one-shot Item, which means that unlike equipment, it can be played from your hand during combat or on your opponent's turn.
t1.oneshot.v2	Great! Now you can turn the table with that Freezing Explosive Potion in your inventory! You can open your inventory to access it, or tap its button next to your avatar.
t1.rewards	Fantastic work! Any time you defeat a monster, you gain a level! You also gain the Harpies' listed reward of 2 treasures.
t1.charity.warning	Hmm, it seems you have 6 cards in hand. If you end the turn with more than 5, you'll have to give cards to the lowest-level opponent to compensate. To avoid that, why don't you sell those two Treasures you drew – you can't use 'em anyway.
t1.sell	Each Item has a Gold Piece value in its lower left corner. During your turn when you are not in combat, you can sell 1000 Gold Pieces worth of Items to gain a level. Press the sell Items button to sell your Cloak and Hat.
t1.pass	Great, you're off to quite a start! Now it's time for Gary and I to take our turns. Press Done to pass the turn to the next player.
t1.op1.chainsaw	Can't wait to chop some monsters up with this bad boy!
t1.op1.jump.in	You can Jump In during your opponents' turns too. Gary just played that "Big" Chainsaw, so why don't you jump in and play that "Lose Big Item" Curse on him?
t1.op1.gary.annoyed	What did you do that for?!
t1.op1.retort	Life sucks and people are jerks, Gary!
t1.op1.gary.sulk	Whatever. If you weren't a dumb newb, you'd have waited until I was in combat to really get me. Curses can be played any time, ya know.
t1.op1.end.jump.in	Yeah, but it was fun to do it now! Let's see what Gary does next.
t1.kick	Your turn again. Looks to me like you're ready to Kick Open that Door!
t1.curse	Oh no, a Curse! Sometimes you will find things other than Monsters when Kicking Open the Door. If it's something like a Class or Race card you'll just draw it, but if it's a Curse, it's immediately played – on you!
t1.curse.2	You'll have to lose that Slimy Armor. On the bright side, maybe someday you'll feel clean again.
t1.trouble	If you don't encounter a monster, you get the choice to either Look For Trouble by playing a monster from your hand or Loot The Room to draw another Door card.
t1.trouble.2	Those Crabs you've got in hand should be easy to stomp, so why don't you Look for Trouble and play them?
t1.gary.comment	Ha, I can't let you win that easily! I'm going to play a Monster Enhancer to make those Crabs Intelligent. They are now level 6, but will give out an additional Treasure if defeated.
t1.help	Looks like you are short a few strength. Thankfully I'm here to help. You can press the Ask For Help button to request another player add their strength to your strength in battle.
t1.help.3	Since you're the only one who gains the level for defeating the monster, you'll usually have to bribe people to help you. I'll help you out for the low, low price of a single Treasure.
t1.offer.2	I accept the offer. Time to enjoy some crab cakes!
t1.offer.3	You won't be able to equip your Mace of Sharpness now since you are not a Cleric. But go ahead and play it to your Carry area. Perhaps you will find a use for it later.
t1.op2.fight	You've met your match, tiny dog!
t1.op2.enrage	Looks like a chance to give Gary a taste of his own medicine. Jump in and Enrage that pooch!
t1.op2.gary.grumble	Next Gary will try and Run Away by rolling a six sided die. On a roll of 5 or higher he avoids the negative effect of the monsters "Bad Stuff".
t1.op2.gary.loss	Ow, my aching everything!
t1.trade	Hmmm.... It seems we both have an Item that can only be equipped by each others' Class. Let's swap!
t1.trade.2	Any time players aren't in combat they may trade Items. Press the Trade button now to offer me a trade.
t1.trade.4	Pleasure doing business with you! You can check your gear at any time by clicking your avatar.
t1.op3.horror	*SHRIEK!* Not the Unspeakably Awful Indescribable Horror! Death becomes me!
t1.op3.death	Poor Gary. When a player dies, they lose all their stuff other than their Race, Class, Curses, and Level, and are out of the game until the following turn. On their next turn they will draw a new starting hand.
t1.op3.death.2	But first we get to loot the body, taking one of his cards. Go ahead and take anything that suits your fancy!
t1.op3.tutorial.end	Well, now that you've looted your first corpse, I think it's safe to say you're a true Munchkin! From here on out, I'll be trying to beat you, not teach you. If you have any questions, check the rulebook in the settings menu.
t1.op3.tutorial.end2	First player to level 5 wins this time (normally 10). And remember, your last level must be earned by killing a monster!
t1.op3.tutorial.end3	Oh good, I was just getting warmed up! May the best adventurer win!
t1.play.items3.demo	Munchkins may only equip one Footgear, Armor, and Headgear, and may only have 1 Item in each hand (or a single two handed Item). You may also only have one Big Item at a time.
t1.charity.warning.demo	Hmm, it seems you have 6 cards in hand. If you end the turn with more than 5, you'll have to give cards to the lowest-level opponent.
t1.sell.demo	To avoid having to give things away to Charity, you should make sure to play your cards.
t1.pass.demo	Your Pointy Hat of Power can only be equipped by a Wizard so it's not especially useful but you can drag it to your Carry area to keep it out of your hand. It won't provide any strength while there.
t1.crabs.demo	Time to enjoy some crab cakes!
kin.tutorial.leave	Leave
kin.tutorial.finish	Finish the Game!
t1.op3.tutorial.end1	Well, now that you've showed Gary who is boss, you're on your way to being a Munchkin pro! From here on out, I'll be trying to beat you, not teach you.
t2.set.1	Time for another adventure! Why don't you try thieving this time?
t2.set.2	The Thief, really? Did you go through the deck and find the card with the most text to read? What kind of tutorial is this?
t2.turn1.1	Boy, looks like you drew a bunch of useless items. But at least they are worth some gold! Let's see if we can pawn them off on someone else!
t2.turn1.2	During your turn, when you are not in combat, you can sell 1000 gold worth of items to gain a level. Head to your inventory screen and sell your Stepladder and Shield.
t2.turn1.3	So you got a level, big deal. I'd rather have a good Item.
t2.turn1.4	I do like Items. And as a Cleric, I'd really like that Mace of Sharpness you've got there. Why don't you get that into play so you can trade it to me?
t2.turn1.5	I'm carrying a Dagger that would be perfect for your Thief Class to give you in return. Drag the Mace and Dagger down to the trade areas.
t2.turn1.7	Yikes, you're going to need a hand fighting this troll. Press this Ask For Help button to bring me in and my strength will be added to your side!
t2.turn1.8	Since you're the only one who gains the level for defeating the monster, you'll usually have to bribe people to help you. I'll help you out for the low, low price of a single Treasure.
t2.turn1.9	You're lucky I don't have a monster enhancer right now -- you'd BOTH get hit with the bad stuff if you lost!
t2.turn1.enemy.1	Jump in now to put your thieving skills to work against Gary.
t2.turn1.enemy.2	Your abilities will show up here in your action area when available. Discard Bullrog with Backstab to reduce Gary's strength.
t2.turn1.enemy.3	Hmm... Gary didn't like that one bit. You can track how friendly an AI opponent is here. Players will become more or less friendly as a result of your actions towards them and act accordingly. But beware! The only person you can trust is yourself.
t2.turn1.enemy.4	*SHRIEK!* Not the Unspeakably Awful Indescribable Horror! Death becomes me!
t2.turn1.enemy.5	Poor Gary. When a player dies, they lose all their stuff other than their Race, Class, Curses, and Level, and are out of the game until the following turn. On their next turn they will draw a new starting hand.
t2.turn1.enemy.6	But first we get to loot the body, taking one of his cards. You haven't got any armor yet, so why don't you grab that Flaming Armor?
t2.turn1.enemy.7	Well, now that you've looted your first corpse, I think it's safe to say you're a true Munchkin expert! From here on out, I'll be trying to beat you to level 10, not teach you. If you have any questions, check the rulebook in the settings menu.
t2.turn1.enemy.8	Now, shall we finish this game? Or would you rather start a game from scratch in Solo Play, Challenges, or Online Play?
t2.turn1.triggered.1	Oh good, I was just getting warmed up! May the best adventurer win!
t2.turn1.triggered.2	Hey (position) isn't so bad for your first real game. You'll show us whose boss in no time!
t2.turn1.triggered.3	Incredible! A win on your very first game!?! Gary will never let me hear the end of this....
ftt.undead	You have an undead card in hand. Undead can be played during combat to join another undead.
ftt.multi.monster	You are facing two monsters. To defeat them you must have more power than their total combined strength.
t1.curse.3	Curses that you have drawn outside of Kicking Open the Door can be played on other players. Try cursing Gary with "Lose Big Item".
